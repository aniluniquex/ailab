 AIM: Implement Depth First Search using Python.
 What is DFS:
 Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data
 structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root
 node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before
 backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered
 so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.
 Let us understand the working of Depth First Search with the help of the following
 illustration:
 Step1: Initially stack and visited arrays are empty.
 Step 2: Visit 0 and put its adjacent nodes which are not visited yet into the stack.
Step 3: Now, Node 1 at the top of the stack, so visit node 1 and pop it from the stack and put
 all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.
 Step 4: Now, Node 2 at the top of the stack, so visit node 2 and pop it from the stack and put
 all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited (i.e, 3, 4) in the stack.
Step 5: Now, Node 4 at the top of the stack, so visit node 4 and pop it from the stack and put
 all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.
 Step 6: Now, Node 3 at the top of the stack, so visit node 3 and pop it from the stack and put
 all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.
Now, Stack becomes empty, which means we have visited all the nodes and our DFS traversal
 ends.
Consider the following graph which is implemented in the code below:
 Example of DFS:
 # Using a Python dictionary to act as an adjacency list
 graph = {
 '5' : ['3','7'],
 '3' : ['2', '4'],
 '7' : ['8'],
 '2' : [],
 '4' : ['8'],
 '8' : []
 }
 visited = set() # Set to keep track of visited nodes of graph.
 def dfs(visited, graph, node): #function for dfs
 if node not in visited:
 print (node)
 visited.add(node)
 for neighbour in graph[node]:
 dfs(visited, graph, neighbour)
 # Driver Code
 print("Following is the Depth-First Search")
 dfs(visited, graph, '5')
 Output
 The output of the above code is as follow:
 Following is the Depth-First Search
