WEEK-5
 AIM: Implement Water-Jug problem using Python.
 What is Water-Jug problem:
 In the water jug problem in Artificial Intelligence, we are provided with two jugs: one having
 the capacity to hold 3 gallons of water and the other has the capacity to hold 4 gallons of
 water. There is no other measuring equipment available and the jugs also do not have any
 kind of marking on them. So, the agentâ€™s task here is to fill the 4-gallon jug with 2 gallons of
 water by using only these two jugs and no other material. Initially, both our jugs are empty.
 So, to solve this problem, following set of rules were proposed:
 Production rules for solving the water jug problem
 Here, let x denote the 4-gallon jug and y denote the 3-gallon jug.
 The listed production rules contain all the actions that could be performed by the agent in
 transferring the contents of jugs. But, to solve the water jug problem in a minimum number of
 moves, following set of rules in the given sequence should be performed:
 Solution of water jug problem according to the production rules
On reaching the 7th attempt, we reach a state which is our goal state. Therefore, at this state,
 our problem is solved.
 Program:
 print("Water Jug Problem")
 x=int(input("Enter X="))
 y=int(input("Enter Y="))
 while True:
 rno=int(input("Enter the Rule No="))
 if rno==1:
 if x<4:
 x=4
 if rno==2:
 if y<3:
 y=3
 if rno==5:
 if x>0:
 x=0
 if rno==6:
 if y>0:
 y=0
 if rno==7:
 if x+y >= 4 and y > 0:
x,y = 4,y-(4-x)
 if rno==8:
 if x+y >= 3 and x > 0:
 x,y= x-(3-y),3
 if rno==9:
 if x+y <=4 and y>0:
 x,y=x+y,0
 if rno==10:
 if x+y<=3 and x>0:
 x,y=0,x+y
 print("X =",x)
 print("Y =",y)
 if(x==2):
 print("The result is a Goal State")
 break
 OUTPUT:
 Water Jug Problem
 Enter X=0
 Enter Y=0
 Enter the Rule No=2
 X=0
 Y=3
 Enter the Rule No=9
 X=3
 Y=0
 Enter the Rule No=2
 X=3
 Y=3
 Enter the Rule No=7
 X=4
Y=2
 Enter the Rule No=5
 X=0
 Y=2
 Enter the Rule No=9
 X=2
 Y=0
 The result is a Goal State
